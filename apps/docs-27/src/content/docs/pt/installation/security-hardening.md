title: "Appendix 5: Increase the security of your XOOPS installation"
---

After installing XOOPS 2.7.0, take the following steps to harden the site. Each step is optional individually, but together they raise the baseline security of the install significantly.

## 1. Install and configure the Protector module

The bundled `protector` module is the XOOPS firewall. If you did not install it during the initial wizard, install it from the Admin → Modules screen now.

Open Protector's admin panel and review the warnings it displays. Legacy PHP directives such as `register_globals` no longer exist (PHP 8.2+ has removed them), so you will not see those warnings anymore. Current warnings usually relate to directory permissions, session settings, and trust-path configuration.

## 2. Lock down `mainfile.php` and `secure.php`

When the installer finishes it tries to mark both files as read-only, but some hosts revert the permissions. Verify and re-apply if needed:

- `mainfile.php` → `0444` (owner, group, other read-only)
- `xoops_data/data/secure.php` → `0444`

`mainfile.php` defines the path constants (`XOOPS_ROOT_PATH`, `XOOPS_PATH`, `XOOPS_VAR_PATH`, `XOOPS_URL`, `XOOPS_COOKIE_DOMAIN`, `XOOPS_COOKIE_DOMAIN_USE_PSL`) and production flags. `secure.php` holds the database credentials:

- In 2.5.x, the database credentials used to live in `mainfile.php`. They are now stored in `xoops_data/data/secure.php`, which is loaded by `mainfile.php` at runtime. Keeping `secure.php` inside `xoops_data/` — a directory you are encouraged to relocate outside the document root — makes it much harder for an attacker to reach the credentials over HTTP.

## 3. Move `xoops_lib/` and `xoops_data/` outside the document root

If you have not already done so, move these two directories one level above your web root and rename them. Then update the corresponding constants in `mainfile.php`:

```php
define('XOOPS_ROOT_PATH', '/home/you/www');
define('XOOPS_PATH',      '/home/you/zubra_mylib');
define('XOOPS_VAR_PATH',  '/home/you/zubra_mydata');
define('XOOPS_TRUST_PATH', XOOPS_PATH);
```

Placing these directories outside the document root prevents direct access to Composer's `vendor/` tree, cached templates, session files, uploaded data, and the database credentials in `secure.php`.

## 4. Cookie domain configuration

XOOPS 2.7.0 introduces two cookie-domain constants in `mainfile.php`:

```php
// Use the Public Suffix List (PSL) to derive the registrable domain.
define('XOOPS_COOKIE_DOMAIN_USE_PSL', true);

// Explicit cookie domain; may be blank, the full host, or the registrable domain.
define('XOOPS_COOKIE_DOMAIN', '');
```

Guidelines:

- Leave `XOOPS_COOKIE_DOMAIN` blank if you serve XOOPS from a single hostname or from an IP.
- Use the full host (e.g. `www.example.com`) to scope cookies to that hostname only.
- Use the registrable domain (e.g. `example.com`) when you want cookies shared across `www.example.com`, `blog.example.com`, etc.
- `XOOPS_COOKIE_DOMAIN_USE_PSL = true` lets XOOPS correctly split compound TLDs (`co.uk`, `com.au`, …) instead of accidentally setting a cookie on the effective TLD.

## 5. Production flags in `mainfile.php`

`mainfile.dist.php` ships with these two flags set to `false` for production:

```php
define('XOOPS_DB_LEGACY_LOG', false); // disable legacy SQL usage logging
define('XOOPS_DEBUG',         false); // disable debug notices
```

Leave them off on production. Enable them temporarily in a development or staging environment when you want to:

- hunt down lingering legacy database calls (`XOOPS_DB_LEGACY_LOG = true`);
- surface `E_USER_DEPRECATED` notices and other debug output (`XOOPS_DEBUG = true`).

## 6. Delete the installer

After the install is complete:

1. Delete any renamed `install_remove_*` directory from the web root.
2. Delete any `install_cleanup_*.php` script that the wizard created during cleanup.
3. Confirm the `install/` directory is no longer reachable over HTTP.

Leaving a disabled but present installer directory is a low-severity but avoidable risk.

## 7. Keep XOOPS and modules up to date

XOOPS follows a regular patch cadence. Subscribe to the XoopsCore27 GitHub repository for release notifications, and update your site and any third-party modules whenever a new release ships. The security updates for 2.7.x are published via the repository's Releases page.
